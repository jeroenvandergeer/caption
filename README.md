  <h6 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h6>
  <p align="center">Caption is a great little app that takes the effort out of finding and setting up the right subtitles. It has a simple, uncomplicated design, a drag &amp; drop search feature, automatic downloading and automatic renaming. Caption is completely <strong>open-source</strong> and made with web technology.</p>
